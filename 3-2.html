    <h1>What is Web Design?</h1>
    <p>
      Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the
      internet. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website
      development rather than software develsopment. Web design used to be
      focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the
      mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become
      ever-increasingly important.
